    <h1>🔧 Automated Fault Detection in Turbocharger Using Machine Vision</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>📖 Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As part of my internship, I developed an automated real-time fault detection system using machine vision techniques. The system inspects turbocharger components using a camera and machine learning model to identify missing or defective parts during production, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of quality control in manufacturing.

      <h2>🚀 How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        - The camera captures frames of turbochargers on the assembly line<br>
        - Each frame is analyzed in real time by a trained ML model<br>
        - If a missing component or defect is detected, the system highlights the issue<br>
        - A report is logged, and optional alerts are raised to quality control<br>
        - Data is stored for further analysis and system improvement
